# Remix Notes App

In this project, I will build a notes app in Remix to learn it first hand.

I have a limited understanding of this so it's my goal to learn it along the way and have a good grasp of the framework by the end of this project

I also want to learn some related areas that I'm currently learning such as databases, authentication/authorization, etc.

## Description

The notes app is a note taking app that allows users to add a note, view their notes, edit a note, and delete a note.

Users can create an account (via email/password).

### Future improvements

In the future (that is, after the core features are implemented, I'm looking forward to implement a Kanban board to allow classifications of notes).

#### Tech and development related

I also intend to add Storybook and testing, like Jest in the future.

Then, use Amazon Cognito for Auth. Replace the custom built I made. Also add Sign in with 3rd party providers such as Google, Facebook, etc.
